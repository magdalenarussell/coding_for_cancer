# Part a: Practicing variables and math operations

## Instructions:

## Write a code chunk to introduce yourself to those in the breakout room
      * use a combo of character, numeric, integer, and logical data types
      * feel free to be creative!
      * use math operations (e.g. * or -) to modify your integer or numeric variables
      * declare a variable and reassign later in your script
      * try to assign at least 5 variables

## Example:

```{r}
myname <- "maggie"
fav_color <- FALSE 
height_ft <- 5 + 8/12
fav_color <- "green"
```

## Note: consult the week 1 cheat sheet (or ask an instructor) if you have questions

```{r}
# add your code here...

```
