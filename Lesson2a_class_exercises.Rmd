__Under each heading below, type your code and run it. Feel free to add notes and comments to help you learn.__ 

__We recommend typing out the code over copying and pasting as figuring out where you made mistakes is a normal and key part of coding! Talk to an instructor if you get stuck. :)__



# Basic math (type below this line)

```{r}
# This is a code chunk!
## [add 4 and 5 together using the "+" operator, just like in math class :)]

# write your code here...

```

What is the answer? (be sure to run your code chunk) 


# Assigning value to an object

```{r}
weight_kg <- #[fill in here]

```

# Recall object

```{r}
weight_kg

```

What was returned when you ran the previous code chunk?


# Multiplication on an object (convert kg to lb)

```{r}
# [Multiply weight_kg by 2.2]


```

# Assign weight conversion to object

```{r}
# [copy your multiplication above and assign it to "weight_lb"]
# (hint: see the assignment operator above)


```


# Reassign new value to an object

```{r}
weight_kg <- ## assign to one hundred


```

# Now, recall the `weight_kg` object

```{r}
weight_kg

```

What value was returned when you ran the above code chunk?
