# assign vector: 4 ages (50, 55, 60, 65)

```{r}
# run this code chunk
ages <- c(50, 55, 60, 65)

```

# extracts values which meet condition

```{r}
ages[ages > 60] # run me!

```

What was the result?


# extracts values numerically equivalent values

```{r}
ages[ages == 60] #run me!

```

What was the result?


# ages less than 50 OR greater than 60

```{r}
# insert code here, use the OR operator

```

What was the result?


# ages greater than 50 AND less than 60

```{r}
# insert code here, use the AND operator

```

What was the result?


# recall: extract values which meet condition

```{r}
ages[ages > 60] 

```

# negate and return the opposite

```{r}
# insert here, use the NOT logical operator

```

What was the result?


# create a vector with missing data

```{r}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6) # run me!

```

# calculate mean and max on vector with missing data

```{r}
## [add mean code here]

```

```{r}
## [add max code here]

```

# add argument to remove NA

```{r}
## [add code here]

```

What is the result now?


# identify elements which are missing data

```{r}
## [add code here]

```

# reverse the TRUE/FALSE

# insert here, use the NOT logical operator

```{r}
## [add code here]

```

# extract elements which are not missing values (not NAs)

```{r}
## [add code here]

```

# assign to a new object

```{r}
heights_without_NA = #fill me in

```

# see if mean can be calculated normally now

```{r}
#run me
mean(heights_without_NA)
```

What is the result?
