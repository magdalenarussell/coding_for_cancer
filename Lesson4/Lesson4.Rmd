# Data: Effect of vitamin C on odontoblast growth in guinea pig teeth

We are going to be working with the same dataset that we have been using the last few lessons

Description: Treated guinea pigs with orange juice (OJ) in two doses or ascorbic acid (VC) in three doses or a set period of time and then measured the odontoblast (cells responsible for repairing/maintaining the dentin in your tooth) length (in picometeres)

Source: Crampton, E. W. (1947). The growth of the odontoblast of the incisor teeth as a criterion of vitamin C intake of the guinea pig. The Journal of Nutrition, 33(5), 491–504. doi: 10.1093/jn/33.5.491.


# Part 1: Familiarizing yourself with new data 

## Instructions:

When working with new data, it's important to familiarize yourself with its structure before performing analyses. Consult your cheatsheet/notes and perform the following:
    * Determine the dimensions of ToothGrowth using the appropriate function
    * View the full dataset. Are there any missing or surprising values?
    * Extract the first 4 lines of the dataset; then extract the last 3 lines of the dataset
    * Save the column names to a vector named "cols"
    * Access the summary statistics for the dataset

## Run me!

```{r}
TG <- ToothGrowth ## Access the dataset with either "TG" or "ToothGrowth"
```

```{r}
# your code here...

```


## Part II: Practicing vector operations and functions

## Instructions:

Let’s say we want to just compare the 1.0 dosage of orange juice (OJ) and ascorbic acid (VC).

Use the filtering methods we learned last session (e.g. ages[ages > 50]) to isolate just the rows where the dose is 1.0 and save it to a variable called `dose1`
Hint 1: Remember that dataframe columns are just vectors 
Hint 2:  When working with dataframes, you need to use the form [my_filter , ] to select all columns

```{r}
# your code here...

```
