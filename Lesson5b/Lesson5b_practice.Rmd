# load library/package (REQUIRED for RStudio cloud users)

```{r}
# run me
library(tidyverse)
```

# import data (same as yesterday!)

```{r}
# run me
clinical <- read.csv("data/clinical.csv")
```

# yesterday we used nested commands to execute multiple commands at once 

```{r}
# select patients with Stage IV cancer, then select only the race, ethnicity, and stage columns
race_stage <- select(filter(clinical, ajcc_pathologic_stage == "Stage IV"), race, ethnicity, ajcc_pathologic_stage)
```

# same task as above, but with pipes

```{r}
piped <- #fill in here
```

# extract race, ethnicity, and age at diagnosis from cases born prior to 1930

```{r}
piped2 <- #fill in here
```

# convert days to years

```{r}
clinical_years <- #fill in here
```

# convert days to year and months at same time, and we don't always need to assign to object

```{r}
# your code here...

```
