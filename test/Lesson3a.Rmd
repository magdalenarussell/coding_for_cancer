# Data: Effect of vitamin C on odontoblast growth in guinea pig teet

Scientists treated guinea pigs with low or high dose vitamin C (via orange juice) for a set period of time and then measured the odontoblast (cells responsible for repairing/maintaing the dentin in your tooth) length (in picometeres)

# Just run this portion to load the data
This code chunk will create the datasets we will be using for these problems (no need to understand this code at this point in the course)

```{r}
# run me
TG = ToothGrowth
low_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 1), "len"]
high_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 2), "len"]

```


# Practicing vector operations and functions

## Instructions:
Work in your small groups and complete the following:

* Use the functions we've learned so far to determine the following about the `low_dose` and `high_dose` vectors:
    * Do both high and lose dose sets have the same length and class?
    * What is the mean and median of both groups?
    * What is the third animal in the low dose group?
    * What is the last animal in the high dose group?
    * Save the first through fifth animal in the low dose group to a new variable called `low_dose_subset`
    * What is the mean of the `low_dose_subset`? Is it higher or lower than the mean of the entire low dose group?

```{r}
# add your code here

```

Feel free to add additional code chunks if that is helpful.
