# Data: Effect of vitamin C on odontoblast growth in guinea pig teet

Scientists treated guinea pigs with low or high dose vitamin C (via orange juice) for a set period of time and then measured the odontoblast (cells responsible for repairing/maintaing the dentin in your tooth) length (in picometeres)

Source: Crampton, E. W. (1947). The growth of the odontoblast of the incisor teeth as a criterion of vitamin C intake of the guinea pig. The Journal of Nutrition, 33(5), 491â€“504. doi: 10.1093/jn/33.5.491.

# Just run this portion to load the data
This code chunk will create the datasets we will be using for these problems (no need to understand this code at this point in the course)

```{r}
# run me
TG = ToothGrowth
low_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 1), "len"]
high_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 2), "len"]

```

## Instructions:
Work in your small groups and complete the following:

# Part 1:

After collecting the data, you found out that two animals had health issues and should be removed from the data. Save the high and low dose vectors to new names (e.g. fixed_high, fixed_low). Then, set the values that correspond to the two animals below to NA.
    * the third animal in the low dose group
    * the last animal in the high dose group


```{r}
# add your code here

```

# Part 2: Working with missing data 

Use the new vectors you created in part 1 for these problems. 

What is the new median of the tooth lengths in each group? (Remember to remove NAs when determining the median)

```{r}
# add your code here

```

# Part 3: Practicing vector subsetting

Use the new vectors you created in part 1 for these problems. 

Let's say the normal range for odontoblasts in captive guinea pigs is 22 +/- 2 picometers. Determine:
    * How many values are greater than this typical range (i.e. greater than 24) in each of the fixed vectors? Hint: Subset the vectors based on the values. Check to make sure only what you expect is there. Remove the NAs if necessary. Then determine the length of those vectors.
    * How many values are greater or equal to 20 and less than or equal to 24 picometers in each group (i.e. each vector)? Hint: Use & to use two expressions together (e.g. x[x > 9 & x <= 14])

```{r}
# add your code here

```

Discuss in your small groups:
    * Does a higher dose of orange juice seem to lead to longer osteoblasts in guinea pigs?
